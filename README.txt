Do NOT submit a project you find online or generated by AI systems as your own.  Give credit to any resources you use when completing this project.  (ex. Works Cited PPT slide) Taking credit for someone else's work will be considered cheating and academic misconduct.


#C Program (80% of Grade)

Your finished project should demonstrate the following concepts we learned in class:

-thoughtful selection of variable names
-easy to read and well-documented code
-arrays
-robust error checking
-if statements
-while and/or do-while
-for loops
-multiple user-defined functions
-file I/O
-multiple source code files and header files
-good programming practices
-C comments describing the code
-professionalism
-style guide Google’s coding guidelines: https://Links to an external site.google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.htmlLinks to an external site.  Your Style Guide doesn’t have to be nearly this extensive, but when I look at the files produced by different group members, coding styles should match.
-Include a comment section at the top of each file with the name of the Group member who contributed to the code.  Each group member should have an equal role in designing/writing/debugging code. 


#Presentation (20% of grade) 
-Create a PowerPoint (or other graphical) presentation that is aimed at your target audience (our class). 

-Must be 10 minutes long.  Presentations will be done in class.  Be able to correctly use C vocabulary words from class during your presentation.  
You will be expected to be an attentive listener during all of your classmates’ presentations.

#Task Division:
-Amando: Slot machine
-Sid and Keven: Poker
